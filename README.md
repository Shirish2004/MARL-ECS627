## Assignment 1

### Question-1:

![ass1_q1_1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55e4df15-0357-4b0c-bbc4-44f153ef1d16)

Both Value Iteration and Policy Iteration suggest the same optimal policy for the student: attending class at each location (Hostel, Academic Building, Canteen). This outcome makes sense given the higher rewards associated with attending class, especially in the Academic Building where the reward is +3. The uniformity of the policy across all states suggests that, regardless of where the student is on campus, attending class maximizes long-term rewards. 

### Question 2:
